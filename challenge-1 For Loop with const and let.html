<!-- Constants are block-scoped, much like variables declared using the let keyword.
     The value of a constant can't be changed through reassignment 
     (i.e. by using the assignment operator), and it can't be redeclared 
     (i.e. through a variable declaration). However, 
     if a constant is an object or array its properties or items can be updated or removed. -->

     <!-- The const keyword was introduced in ES6 (2015).

Variables defined with const cannot be Redeclared.

Variables defined with const cannot be Reassigned.

Variables defined with const have Block Scope. -->



     <!-- The simple assignment operator (=) is used to assign a value to a variable. -->

     <!-- Declarations
JavaScript has three kinds of variable declarations.

var
Declares a variable, optionally initializing it to a value.

let
Declares a block-scoped, local variable, optionally initializing it to a value.

const
Declares a block-scoped, read-only named constant. -->

    <h2>JavaScript For Loop</h2>
    <p id="demo"></p>
    <script>
        const chocolates = ["Cadbury", "M&M", "Snickers", "Ferrero rocher"];
        let i = 0;
        let length = chocolates.length;
        let text = "";
        for (; i < length; ) {
            text += chocolates[i] + "<br>";
            i++;
            // ++	Increment [Arithmetic Operators]
            // The addition assignment operator (+=) adds a value to a variable.

            // The += assignment operator can also be used to add (concatenate) strings:
        }
        document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = text;
    </script>
    <!-- What does += mean in JavaScript?
The JavaScript += operator takes the values from the right of the operator and adds it 
to the variable on the left. This is a very concise method to add two values and assign the result 
to a variable hence it is called the addition assignment operator.

This operator is not only used to add numerical values but can also be used to concatenate strings together. 
Essentially it replaces the variable = a + b syntax with a += b. -->
